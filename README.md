Hello, 

Welcome and thanks for installing my bot, Hades.
This is the Owner of Hades and Head of the Hades Dept.

A few things that you should know first:
1) Hades can be modified and used for your own purposes. 
# Just FYI: If wanting to make a self-bot you cannot use Hades coding unless it's made with permission given by Hades.
2) Hades is free for all and is used only for legal and entertainment only. 
3) Any damage done to Hades's Clones is not under our catagory, but we will try to help if we can. 

What is the Hades Dept?

Its a group of people that work on Hades, we are looking for new members today, join here: https://discord.gg/NJDYddv , I would love to see more people here working and improving. Over the days or months you can get higher ranks from Silver Member to Admin. 

### Coders are welcome:
We are accepting coders into Hades Dept. Coders by default get admin role. 
Basic Coder registration:
1: Proof that you installed Hades (DM owner)
2: The ability to read and look for any common mistakes
3: And being approved by the Admins that your bot works and shows no signs of copy
Advanced Coder registration:
1: To have been a Basic Coder for at least 2 Weeks
2: Have the ability to code and fix huge mistakes that requires knowledge
3: And to have made a cog that works

*If you pass all of these then you get the rank. As much as we would like to give everyone basic coder rank we wouldn't, only because it has admin role to it and people can abuse that.
